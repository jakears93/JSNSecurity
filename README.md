Our project aims to provide a cost-effective mobile home monitoring solution.  The Raspberry Pi based project is able to provide a live feed through its integrated camera, as well as provide temperature, pressure, humidity as well as gas detection readings.  While this data is being captured, the device simultaneously uploads the live feed/readings to a usersâ€™ account stored via Firebase.  This allows for users to be able to monitor their homes from the workplace or anywhere else where an internet connection is available.
